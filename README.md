# **TLoD-TMD-Converter**

The idea of this tool is to preserve TMD Models as originally shown ingame(*). Much of the tools over internet add or remove stuff from the models (such as: Dragoon wings; convert Quad faces into Tri faces), maybe is not the BEST tool if you want something fast or bug free.

Also i added a very specific functionality for researchers and modders, when you export the 3D model two *.txt files will created, Primitive_per_Object will contain useful data of each primitive type used in models and also the quantity of each one. The other called TMD_Report will be created with a count number of Vertex/Normal/Primitive of each object in the file and a sum of all the file.

## ALPHA V 0.3

A simple converter (to OBJ format and DAE format) oriented to work with TLoD TMD format and to be imported into Blender.
Python coded (recommended version 3.10.2 64bit), so just install python, execute tlod_tmd_converter.py, follow instructions and this tool should do the trick.

Options when executing:

Choose the Type of TMD to analyse:

-tmd (Standard TMD Format).

-ctmd (Custom TMD Format, specific TLoD TMD format). - this option is not currently supported, this part of the project is halted until i finish the complete research.

File path: (example)
C:\modding\TLoD_TMD\file.bin

Also is pretty recommend use the LoDModS tool to dump the TMD files:

(*) This prove to be partially true, the main problem comes with actual 3D Software, which do not support double faces and simply delete them without any warning for the final user, while the older version (Alpha V 0.1) maintain the double faces, newer versions simply use an auto-double face duplication algorithm -sorry-.
