# TLoD-TMD-Mesh-Exporter
ALPHA 0.1

A simple exporter (to Obj format) oriented to work with TLoD TMD format and to be imported into Blender.
Python coded, so just install python, execute tmd_2_obj.py, follow instructions and this tool should do the trick.

Know Issues:
For some reason faces shown in the UV window get disordered or even dissapear from the UV coordinates, this issue is still under investigation, when resolved i will move the project to alpha 0.2.
