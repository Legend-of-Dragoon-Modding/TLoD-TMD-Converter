Animation File Process: This module process files that are animations,
The animations Types supported has been called:
SAF (Simple Animation File).
CMB (Name TBA).
LMB Type 0 (Name TBA).
LMB Type 1 (Name TBA).
LMB Type 2 (Name TBA).

The difference among them is:
SAF support ROTATION/LOCATION SINGLE TMD (Could be animating TMD, TMD_CCONTAINER, TMD_DEFF)
CMB support ROTATION/LOCATION SINGLE and VARIOUS TMDs in the scene (ONLY DEFF)
LMB all Types support ROTATION/LOCATION/SCALE but the difference is done on how are processed internally (ONLY DEFF)
