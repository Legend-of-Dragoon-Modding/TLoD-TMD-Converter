# TLoD-TMD-Converter
ALPHA 0.2
A simple converter (to OBJ format and DAE format) oriented to work with TLoD TMD format and to be imported into Blender.
Python coded, so just install python, execute tmd_2_obj.py, follow instructions and this tool should do the trick.

Options when executing:

Choose the Type of TMD to analyse:

-tmd (Standard TMD Format).
-ctmd (Custom TMD Format, specific TLoD TMD format). - this option is not currently supported, i hope to enable the option in alpha 0.3

File path: (example)
C:\modding\TLoD_TMD\file.bin


The idea of this tool is to preserve the model as originally shown ingame. Much of the tools over internet add or remove stuff from the models (such as: Dragoon wings; convert Quad faces into Tri faces), maybe is not the BEST tool if you want something fast or bug free.

Also i added a very specific functionality for researchers and modders, when you export the 3D model two *.txt files will created, Primitive_per_Object will contain useful data of each primitive type used in models and also the quantity of each one. The other called TMD_Report will be created with a count number of Vertex/Normal/Primitive of each object in the file and a sum of all the file.


i want to thanks a lot to this people who came my main inspiration to learn programming!:

and all the people from the TLoD Global Discord!. Cheers!.
